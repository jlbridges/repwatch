                <strong>RepWatch</strong> is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and their government. 
                We believe that staying informed shouldn't be a full-time job, so we’ve built a centralized space to help you track 
                the people and policies that shape your world. By providing tools to store and organize information about 
                elected officials at all levels of government, RepWatch ensures you always know who is representing your interests.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond tracking individuals, our platform allows you to keep tabs on specific bills and legislation that impact 
                your community. Built with a privacy-first design and secure authentication, RepWatch ensures your data remains 
                protected, allowing you to know and understand how bills and legislation affect you.
